## Reflection

### What have I learnt?
    When I look at what i have learnt from this assignment, there's a lot to talk about. The brief document wasn't as difficult this time around, as it seemed to be very similar to what was required from DES last semester. So in regards to that aspect, not much. When we start talking about the actual physical assignment. My HTML and CSS code is definitely not the strongest, however i have nobody to blame apart from myself for that. If i had completed DES Assignment 3 last semester to a higher level, I would have had a stronger base knowledge of how to deal with the making pages responsive (adjusting to the size of the screen, depending on the platform (Desktop, iPhone, Galaxy etc)). However, I do think that my HTML and CSS has improved drastically since the start of the semester, and that is not doubt due to the amount of time and playing around i have done for this assignment. 


### What do I know now, that I didn't know before?

    I now know that regardless of how comfortable you are with a project, even if you start early to get a head start, something will always get in the way. Which is why practicing is so important. It allows you to encounter these issues before they become said issues. Had I done assignment 3 from DES last semester, it would have put me in a stronger position for this assignment, meaning that i could have had the HTML and CSS completed quickly, and been able to spend my time getting my head around the JavaScript, and Firebase. 

### What new understanding/skills have I gained?

    The skills that i have "gained" from this assessment i feel aren't that many, however my understanding of how to write HTML and CSS has improved significantly (still nowhere near where i would like the to be). My understanding of how to use divs and how to tag elements in the CSS has gone from very, very little, to where i can do it, but there will still be parts where i need to stop, go back, and make sure what i have done is correct.

### Why have I learnt this?

    I've learnt this because it's a must for anyone wanting to be able to work in this industry, which is where i aim to be. I know that with enough time and experience, i will be able to do what i've done in this assignment not in weeks, but days, perhaps hours. I want to be the best, but in order to be the best, you need to put the time into your craft, and that is what i aim to do over the holidays. I'll be hopefully spending time each day to play around, get a better feel for it, and learn new little tips and tricks to allow me to get past the barriers that stopped me in this assessment.

### What is the point?

    As mentioned above, the point of this assessment is to get a hands on feel for how everything fits together. Obviously i've missed out on being able to work in the JavaScript and FireBase, but i still have the notes from the classes, and will be able to go over them in the holidays when i haven't got the stresses of the semester on my back. This will hopefully allow me to get my head around these barriers. 

### What are the real life/work applications?

    I think you would be hard pressed to find a front end developer job that didn't require you to be adept at using HTML CSS and JavaScript. All of these things are a must for the industry. Which is why it is so important to get a handle of them now.

### How have I learnt this?

    The work that ive done on this assessment has been a mixture of previous knowledge, YouTube tutorials, and googling. There have been many little bits where i've thought, "man, XYZ would be awesome to have here, lets see if i can find something online that shows me how to create it". Without these little tips and tricks, doubt the calendar, or select option for the registration page would be there.

### What will I do to remember this learnings?

    This assessment will be staying in my list of repo's on GitHub, that way, if i ever need to use something from it again, i have the base. Other than that, practicing will be the key, and with the summer break coming up, ill have plenty of time to do that. I'm hoping to be able to spend my time improving my weak spots, and getting a better understanding of the different aspects.

### What will I do to fill in any gaps in my understanding?

    FreeCodeCamp is an amazing resource that is free to use, no doubt i will be using that this summer. There are a range of different tasks that it gives you, and with the experience that i have gained from this assessment, i aim to complete some of them over the summer holidays
